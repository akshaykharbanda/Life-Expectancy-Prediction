# Life Expectancy WHO

This project focuses on analyzing life expectancy data from the WHO to understand the factors affecting life expectancy across different countries.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is from Kaggle: [Life Expectancy (WHO)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kumarajarshi/life-expectancy-who).

## Project Overview

### Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
- Dealt with missing values using Mean and Median imputers.
- Handled outliers in the dataset.
- Applied One Hot Encoding for categorical variables.

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Visualized data distributions and relationships between variables.
- Identified key factors affecting life expectancy.

### Machine Learning Models
- Implemented various regression models to predict life expectancy.
- Evaluated models using performance metrics like RMSE, MAE, MAPE and RÂ².

## Results
- Identified significant predictors of life expectancy.
- Improved model accuracy through feature engineering and hyperparameter tuning.

## Conclusion
- Provided insights into factors impacting life expectancy.
- Developed a robust model for predicting life expectancy based on various health and socio-economic factors.
